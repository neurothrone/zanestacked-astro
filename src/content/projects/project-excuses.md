This API is an archive of excuses, ready to deploy at a moment's notice. Whether you need a reason to skip work,
escape a social gathering, or blame your pet for technological failures, we've got you covered.

The Excuse Repository starts with 18 classified excuses across the following categories:

- **Work**: "The spreadsheet corrupted itself."
- **School**: "My dog did, in fact, eat my homework."
- **Social**: "Lost in the time dilation of an afternoon nap."
- **Technology**: "Software update bricked everything."
- **Pets**: "My cat turned off the router."
- **General**: "Unforeseen quantum fluctuations."

New excuses can be forged, refined, and added to the archive, ensuring an ever-expanding database of plausible
deniability.
